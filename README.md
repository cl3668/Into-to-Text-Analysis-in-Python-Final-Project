# Into-to-Text-Analysis-in-Python-Final-Project
This is my final project for the class <br>

<b>Abstract</b> 
As a student focusing on East Asian Studies, the topic of the project will be the Chinese's people attitude toward the government's birth-encouraging policies online. China has been loosening its birth constraint and launching birth-encouraging policies for the past few years. Although it is not hard to imagine that most of the general opinion might not favor these, I am interested in what people on particular topics complain about or discuss regarding the policies. My conclusion for the analysis is that there is not much different for people's attitude toward birth-rate related policies across 2021~2023, and the discussions were most likely to be response to government news.

<b>How to read the project notebooks</b>

The analysis is consisting of three notebooks: Data Collection, Text Analysis, and Appendix, along with some folders, files, graphs for use. Please read the notebook with the below flow:
1. Script1: Data Collection â€“ Weibo web scarping
This notebook includes the introduction to the project, and the data collection part of the analysis. <br> <br>
2. Script2: Text Analysis - Weibo comments
This notebook is the main analysis, starting with stating the analysis framework, then go through the detail codes with conclusion for each step, and coming to the main conclusion with next steps and limitations of the research. <br> <br>
3. Script3: Appendix - Zhihu web scarping and text analysis
This notebook contains the Zhihu web scraping and text analysis I did but decided not to use as for project. The main reason is that the web scraping results were not ideal as I lost 30%~70% of comments for each post for technical reasons. Due to bias concerns, I decided only using Weibo and put the part of Zhihu as appendix.
